## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, I spent time debugging the issue with the remove button. From what I found, all the elements are \
> correctly being removed from the local storage because of this we think the issue is not with the remove \
> button code but with the refreshing code. The refresh issue is being fixed by Victoria and she will be 
> done soon. When she's done with the refresh code, I'll be checking to make sure that the remove button issue \
> is gone.\
> Since I finished my first issue, I spent time looking through the git issues we had. I debated doing the issue \
> where we add a notificiation signaling the status of the class but this issue was 30% backend. I decided not \
> to work on that issue because I wanted to get a better grasp of front end before looking into the backend.\
> I am now working on issue 405 where I'll be notifiying a user when they select a course that conflicts with \
> another or is full.\

## This Week's Plan

> After my accomplishments from last week, I want to start outlining a solution for the notification system \
> and hopefully get that done by next week.
