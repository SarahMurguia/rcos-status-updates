## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I finished the angular tutuorial and began looking at the yacs code base. I was assigned an issue and \ 
> talked to Ada and where that should be implemented. 

## This Week's Plan

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan on finishing my first issue. I have a general idea of what \
> I want to get done, but I'm not sure exactly where to to add the remove button. I was told it should be in \
> the sidebar section of the code but I think it should be in the listing section. I need to ask more questions \ 
> about what this button is supposed to do so I know what section it should be under. \
> I also discovered an issue with the automatic width setting and I let Ada know about that.

## Anything Blocking?

> I don't have any blockers yet, but I do have more to ask the yacs team so that I can implement \
> my first issue properly.

## Notes

> NA
