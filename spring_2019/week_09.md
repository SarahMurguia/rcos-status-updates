## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This last week I presented my designs to the team. There wasn't a design that we really liked so \
> we decided to completely redesign the sidebar and make it more like typical sidebars. Because of \
> how the sidebar is designed right now we can really only change the background and another problem \
> we have is that not much goes with red other than shades or red, gray, black and white. Ideally the |
> new sidebar structure will have a more vertical presentation of data.

## This Week's Plan

> I will be working on the other issue and trying to design a new sidebar.


## Anything Blocking?

> No blockers right now.

## Notes
> None.
