## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I still haven't seen Victoria's code pushed through so the remove button check is still pending\
> I have created around 7 designs for the sidebar and I am still trying to figure out some more.\
> Ada suggested to look at designing a pattern from CSS. I have been researching how to do that, \
> and have found some interesting ways to make triangles with the gradients available through CSS.\
> I haven't picked a design yet, because I am still deciding on the side of the objects in the pattern \
> but I think we will have a new design soon.\
> Other than that, this week has been heavy with other course work/exams. 

## This Week's Plan

> I hope to have the sidebar design done in the next two weeks.


## Anything Blocking?
