## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This last week I discovered an issue with my remove button. When it's the last element in the containter\
> it does not get removed unless the user refreshes. I have attempted to debug this, but I need to learn \ 
> more about all of yacs to get it done. So I've spent some time going over the code that I think it interacts \
> with. I also fixed all the changes from the pull request and my code has been merged to the master yacs \
> branch. 

## This Week's Plan

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan on getting the remove button debuged and ready for use. \
> Over spring break, I plan on learning more about yacs and potentially starting on a new issue.


## Anything Blocking?

> No blockers right now.

## Notes
