## Final Status Update

> This semester was my first semester in RCOS and in the beginning it was a little \
> overwhelming. I choose to work on the yacs project. I think this contributed to the \
> overwhelming feeling because yacs is an old project with a large code base in something \
> I hadn't learned before. The was my first real interaction with web development and I \
> learned angular, but I can't say that I'm a master yet. I worked on implementing a remove \
> button for our new sidebar. This was supposed to be a small and easy task but we had to \
> change some of the underlying structure to make it work. Learning how to add visual aspects \
> to the website wasn't too hard, the hardest part was finding which container to add the \ 
> remove button to and deciding how the user would interact with the button. I decided  to \ 
> add an accessibility feature. This feature provides a description of the button so web \
> readers for the blind can understand and describe it to the user. I also learned how to edit \
> svg icons which was a small thing but definitely a cool thing to know. The toughest part \
> of the remove button, was implementing a service for the sidebar. Services in angular are \
> ways to organize code and they were tough for me to understand so I had help from Ada to \
> implement this. We pretty much used the selection service as a template and we added some \
> basic features including add listing, remove listing and get listings. We also had to do a  \
> little debugging because the services had to be imported in to a lot of places and we didnt \
> get all of them the first time. Another issue we have is when the last class is removed, it \
> still shows up in the sidebar. Ada taught me how to debug online and how to set breakpoints \
> and such to find the root of the issue more quickly. This let me see that our service was \
> correctly removing the listing from the listing data and local storage, but the issue is in \
> how we repopulate the sidebar. While we still havent been able to figure it out we know \
> where it lies. Aside from the yacs project, I attended a bonus session for RCOS and I \
> wish I had set more time to attend these because the one I attended on rust was very \
> interesting. I knew yacs was switching the backend to rust, so I wanted to learn more \
> about it and I thought the implicit returns were interesting.
