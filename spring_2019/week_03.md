## Last Week's Accomplishments

> I worked with Max and Ada to figure out how to remove a course from the sidebar. We found that the issue was \
> more complex than we had initally thought. Ada wrote a new sidebar service to maintain the courses in the \ 
> sidebar and I helped her debug that. I made an icon to remove a class, so I learned how to edit svgs. 

## This Week's Plan

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan on updated the code according to the changes requested \ 
> from Ada on the pull request. Once those changes are made and checked, I will start another issue.

## Anything Blocking?

> No blockers right now.

## Notes

> NA
