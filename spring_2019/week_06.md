## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Victoria finished her refresh code, so once her pull request goes through I will be able to check on the \
> remove button.
> Max and I were talking about the sidebar and we thought that the sidebar was really hard to distinguish \
> from the main content of yacs on mobile. So we opened a new issue for redesigning the sidebar on mobile. \ 
> I will be working on this issue, which is located at https://github.com/YACS-RCOS/yacs/issues/427. I linked \
> the issue here, because I have begun changing the code and have created 5 different versions of the sidebar \
>
> I havent worked on issue 405 because I was working on issue 427. Max suggested that I should use bootstrap \
> alerts to handle this message and that it shouldn't be too invasive so that the user can easily ignore \
> the alert if they wanted too. 


## This Week's Plan

>  For issue 427, the sidebar, I will be taking a look at other sidebars and generating more potential \
> sidebars until we find one that fits yacs the best. \
> For issue 405, I want to learn more about bootstrap and its alerts so I know that I am going to implement. \ 


## Anything Blocking?

> No blockers right now.

## Notes

> If people end of liking one of the more complex designs, issue 427 will likely expand into a harder \
> issue because we will have to either override styling code for the sidebar or implement a new \
> component to organize the style of the sidebar.
