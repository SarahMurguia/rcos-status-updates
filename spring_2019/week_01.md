## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This part week, I learned how to partition my drive and installed linux as a dual boot on my computer. I \
> installed docker and got yacs running on my computer. I began the angular tutuorial and ran into some \
> permissions issues on my computer. I fixed this by starting the tutorial in another location.

## This Week's Plan

> I plan on finding my first issue and contributing to yacs.
