## Last Week's Accomplishments

> This last week was again busy, but I helped make the powerpoint with Max. After our mock \
> presentation, we decided that we needed clearly defined roles for each slide because \
> sometimes people would forget to talk and other times people would talk for other people. \
> Victoria and I went through the slides and added who was going to speak where and ideally \
> this helps with our final presentation.

## This Week's Plan

> I really want to commit another issue before classes end, but im not sure if I will have the time \
> to get the alert working fully before classes end. If not, I will still continue to learn more \
> about bootstrap.


## Anything Blocking?

> No blockers right now.

## Notes
> The refresh issue still exists, but the class is 100% removed from local storage. \
> We still havent found the source, but it has to be occuring when the sidebar updates \
> its display.
